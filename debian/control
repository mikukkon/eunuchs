Section: python
Priority: optional
Maintainer: Tommi Virtanen <tv@debian.org>
Standards-Version: 3.5.6
Build-Depends: python2.2-dev, python2.3-dev

Package: python-eunuchs
Architecture: all
Depends: python, python-twisted, pwgen, python2.3-eunuchs
Description: Missing manly parts of UNIX API for Python
 Eunuchs is a library of Python extension that complement the standard
 libraries in parts where full support for the UNIX API (or the Linux
 API) is missing.
 .
 Most of the functions wrapped by Eunuchs are low-level, dirty, but
 absolutely necessary functions for real systems programming. The aim is
 to have the functions added to mainstream Python libraries.
 .
 Current list of functions included:
 .
 - fchdir(2)
 .
 - recvmsg(2) and sendmsg(2), including use of cmsg(3)
 .
 - socketpair(2)
 .
 This is a dummy package that depends on the correct version of
 python-eunuchs for the default version of Python.
