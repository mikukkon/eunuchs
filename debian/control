Description: Missing manly parts of UNIX API for Python
 Eunuchs is a library of Python extensions that complement the standard
 libraries in parts where full support for the UNIX API (or the Linux
 API) is missing.
 .
 Most of the functions wrapped by Eunuchs are low-level, dirty, but
 absolutely necessary functions for real systems programming. The aim is
 to have the functions added to mainstream Python libraries.
 .
 Current list of features included:
 .
 - recvmsg(2) and sendmsg(2), including use of cmsg(3)
 .
 - socketpair(2)
 .
 - support for TUN/TAP virtual network interfaces
 .
 This is a dummy package that depends on the correct version of
 python-eunuchs for the default version of Python.
